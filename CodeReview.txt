C18A-1 Code Reveiw 
Senya Stein
Software Engineering Section C

Questions: 

-Is the code readable and easy to follow? How could we improve this?
-Is there anything that looks like it could cause future errors? 
-What portions could use the most refactoring?
-Does it work the way it should without issues?
-Are our class/variable/method names consisent and logical?


Comments about our code:

-line 189 make public or private
-door to room linker 
-way more comments
-seperate line 233 to make easier to read 
-more intuitive var names (change x, y, to rows and columns,  genAdj <- line 170) and rename methods
-refactor methods for scanning in files
-checkRooms has random long space in string, refactor w "\n" or "\t"
-like the different methods for linking rooms and doors
-be clear and comment when function is recursive 
-make sure each class file has authors' names



My comments on other groups' code:

-Group 1 has really good comments, makes it easy to see what's going on
-Group 1 looked for substr of '//' to check for commented lines when reading in - clever 
-Group 1 needs to refactor calcAdj, or throw code into new method and call it
-Group 1 added more than the defalt to DoorDirection enum to streamline it
-Group 2 checks txt format card types to check for formatting 
-Group 2 has very neat readable code, could use more commenting
-Group 2 initilization could use a little refactoring/clarifying comments
-Group 2 handles oopening file and getting info in a single functions, a little redundant code and confusing shrot var names
