Code Review 2
Jonathan Dimercurio and Senya Stein
Group Beta, Room 2

Notes for First Presenter:
-Needs to finish GUI funcionality
-Hasn't addded code for event driven functionality
-Could use more comments, before each method or loop
-Vars have vague names (eg i, j, g)
-Can't get targets to paint correctly

Notes for Our Group:
-Layer a bunch of JPanels to resolve our board layout issue
-Function called "create panel" and call itself to create morea panels and layer them
-Use grid layout not bag layout
-Set columns = 0, row  = 1 to get easier formatting
-Good job with alot of classes
-Do the instructions say all the stuff we put into different classes need to al be in Board?

Notes for Last Presenting Group:
-Cool added music
-Pop up windows could use more color to differentiate functions
-Good commenting
